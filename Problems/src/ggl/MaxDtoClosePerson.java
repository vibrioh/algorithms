Intuition

Let left[i] be the distance from seat i to the closest person sitting to the left of i. Similarly, let right[i] be the distance to the closest person sitting to the right of i. This is motivated by the idea that the closest person in seat i sits a distance min(left[i], right[i]) away.

Algorithm

To construct left[i], notice it is either left[i-1] + 1 if the seat is empty, or 0 if it is full. right[i] is constructed in a similar way.
