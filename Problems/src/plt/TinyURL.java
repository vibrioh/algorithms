/*
Performance Analysis

The number of URLs that can be encoded is quite large in this case, nearly of the order (10+26*2)^6(10+26âˆ—2)
6
 .

The length of the encoded URLs is fixed to 6 units, which is a significant reduction for very large URLs.

The performance of this scheme is quite good, due to a very less probability of repeated same codes generated.

We can increase the number of encodings possible as well, by increasing the length of the encoded strings. Thus, there exists a tradeoff between the length of the code and the number of encodings possible.

Predicting the encoding isn't possible in this scheme since random numbers are used.
